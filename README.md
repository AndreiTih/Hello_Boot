## Writing a string on the screen after booting off the B.I.O.S.

This is a repo containing the code accompanying this article on my website.

<br>

Since each article is part of a series of 2, I've split the code into 2 parts, where the Part1 folder contains all code referenced in the part 1 article, and the part 2 folder contains all code referenced in the part 2 article.

Refer to the readme.md file in those folders for instructions on how to compile and execute the code.
